These are some localized graphics for SDVX EG that I'm making for my own use, but am mirroring here in the case anyone else would like to use them. 
These are offered on the terms that you know what you're doing, as I will not be offering support aside genuine repo issues - feel free to report those.

Note - this is not a full J region translation, it is meant to help add more English to J region specific options, and is tested using A region. 

Files are tested with https://github.com/mon/ifstools - repacked files will not be provided for obvious reasons.
